## Important Warnings

- **Security**: The current authentication module is basic, with a default username/password set to `admin/admin`. Do not install it in production or make it publicly accessible without implementing more secure authentication.
- **GDPR Compliance**: This version is not fully compliant with GDPR. In particular, user IP addresses are stored in plain text without hashing. Other elements related to compliance are still under review. Use this version with caution and in accordance with local data protection laws.

## Prerequisites

- **PHP**: Version 8.2 or higher.
- **MariaDB/MySQL**: The database has been tested with MariaDB 10.6.
- **Required PHP Extensions**: PDO, mbstring, json, etc.
- **Web Server**: Apache with mod_rewrite enabled.

## Installation

[Detailed Installation guide](./INSTALL.md)

1. **Database**:  
   The database schema is provided in the file `/_database/db_schema.sql`. You can import it into your MariaDB or MySQL instance.

2. **Configuration**:  
   Modify the `Core/config.php` file to adjust database connection settings and the session file paths.

3. **Web Server**:  
   Set the `/public` folder as the root directory for Apache. The `index.php` file in this folder serves as the entry point to the application.

4. **Sessions and Recordings**:  
   User session recordings are managed through the integration of [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb), and the files are stored in the `/_USER_FILES_PRIVATE/` folder.

5. **Dependencies**:  
   This version uses Composer to manage dependencies like `ua-parser/uap-php`. Run `composer install` at the project root to download the required libraries.

## Try the Hosted Version

If you want to explore FlowFinder without setting up a self-hosted instance, you can try our hosted cloud version available at [https://flowfinder.org](https://flowfinder.org).  
The free tier of the cloud version includes all the features of this open-source release, with the following limitations:

- **Rate Limiting**: Only a limited number of sessions can be recorded per minute. Not all sessions are guaranteed to be stored.
- **Data Retention**: Session data retention may vary depending on server availability and capacity.

This option is ideal for quick testing or small-scale usage without needing to configure a backend environment.

FlowFinder.org also offers professional Cloud versions and technical support services.

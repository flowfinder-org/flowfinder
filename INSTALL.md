## 3. Database setup

## 4. Apache configuration

The Apache `DocumentRoot` must point to the `/public` folder, but `.htaccess` should apply from the project root (`./`).

### Example VirtualHost config (XAMPP on Windows):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>  
    ServerName localhost  
    DocumentRoot "C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Git\github.com\flowfinder-org\flowfinder\public"

    <Directory "C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Git\github.com\flowfinder-org\flowfinder">  
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews  
        AllowOverride all  
        Order Deny,Allow  
        Allow from all  
        Require all granted  
    </Directory>  
</VirtualHost>
```

---

## 5. Install dependencies

Run this from the root of the project:

```bash
composer install
```

---

## 6. Run & access

After setting up your virtual host and restarting Apache, visit:

```
http://localhost
```

## 7. Optional services

FlowFinder.org also offers **professional cloud versions** and **technical support services**.
